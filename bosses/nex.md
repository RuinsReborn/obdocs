# Nex

### Requirements

* Level 90 Ranged, Level 90 Defence, Level 74 Prayer
* Good range gear in range setup. Including a weapon (Armadyl Crossbow, Dragon Crossbow, Zaryte Crossbow, Twisted Bow) and ammo (Dragon/rune arrows, or Ruby Dragon Bolts (e)). Atleast 200 of the ammo youre using.
* Supplies: 8 brews, 5 restores, 2 range pots, 1 sanfews, regardless of trip length/quantity.


### Boosts & BIS

* Rune arrows are negative/slower than dragon arrows.
* Zaryte Crossbow is the best in weapon slot.
* Zaryte vambraces are BIS in gloves slot.
* Rigour (Dexterous Prayer Scroll used) gives a boost.
* If using an ely or spectral, your maximum trip length will be longer! This is a new mechanic not really used elsewhere. It means you can kill extra nex's per trip, because they let you sustain for longer. Note: The time is applied per user, e.g. maybe +3 mins per user in the team, for the maximum increase, everyone in the team needs one.
* Spectral has best mage defence bonus in the shield slot.
* Ely reduces death chance by 30%.
* You get faster at killing Nex based on your Offence% (gear) and your KC.

Zaryte Crossbow + Ely, Armadyl Crossbow + Ely, Armadyl Crossbow + Spectral, Twisted Bow (Best to worst)
