Agility is required to participate in a variety of activities.

| Level | Activity          | Bonus                   |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| 15    | Barbarian Fishing |                         |

| 70    | Commander Zilyana |                         |

## Training Methods

Agility can be trained by using the command `+laps [quantity] <course>`. For example: `+laps 10 canifis`.

You can check your total lap counts with the `+m lapcounts` command.

### Rooftop Agility

Rooftop agility courses reward the player with marks of grace which can be used to buy pieces of the Graceful outfit, using the command `+create graceful` or `+create graceful <piece>`, and amylase packs using the command `+buy [quantity] amylase pack`, which will give you 100 amylase crystals per amylase pack costing 10 marks of grace each.

### [Hallowed Sepulchre](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/hallowed-sepulchre)

From level 52 agility, the player may train agility using the command `+sepulchre`, which also requires full Graceful equipped in your skilling setup. You will progressively get better at plundering the sepulchre as your agility level increases, peaking at 92 agility.

### [Brimhaven Agility Arena](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/brimhaven-agility-arena)

The Brimhaven Agility Arena rewards the player with Agility tickets which can be used to purchase cosmetic rewards or agility XP, using the command `+agilityarena`.
